# Work-Day-Scheduler-HW-5

(Edit below to fit homeowrk) 
This week’s homework required to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected. 
This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. 
It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Purpose: ##

* User has a busy schedule
* They need to add important events to a daily planner
* So that the user can manage my time effectively

## Criteria Includes: ##

* WHEN I open the planner
* THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
* WHEN I scroll down
* THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
* WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
* THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
* WHEN I click into a time block
* THEN I can enter an event
* WHEN I click the save button for that time block
* THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
* WHEN I refresh the page
* THEN the saved events persist
